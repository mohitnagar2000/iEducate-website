      <p>A creative professional who is also known as a creative specialist is a person who is employed for the
        extraction of skills in creative endeavors. Creative professions include writing, art, design, theater,
        television, radio, motion pictures, related crafts, as well as marketing, strategy, scientific research
        and development, product development, engineering, some types of teaching and curriculum design, and
        more.
        Since many creative professionals (actors and writers, for example) are also employed in secondary
        professions, estimates of creative professionals are often inaccurate</p>

      <p class="sectiontag text-big">The end of poverty is here</p>
      <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Every year on 17 October, the world marks the International Day for the
        Eradication of Poverty, also known as End Poverty Day. This year the day’s theme puts a spotlight on
        decent work and social protection, putting dignity in practice for all.

        Ending poverty remains a major global challenge. Today, almost 700 million people around the world live
        in extreme poverty, subsisting on less than $2.15 per day. After decades of sustained poverty reduction,
        a period of overlapping shocks and crises resulted in around three years of lost progress between 2020
        and 2022.

        At current rates of progress, the world will likely not meet the global goal of ending extreme poverty
        by 2030, with estimates indicating that nearly 600 million people will still be struggling with extreme
        poverty then.

        Extreme poverty is concentrated in places where it will be hardest to eradicate— among the least
        developed countries, in conflict-affected areas, and in remote, rural areas. The outlook is also grim
        for the nearly 50 percent of the world’s population who live on less than $6.85 a day – the measure used
        for upper-middle-income countries.

      <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Educational technology (commonly abbreviated as edutech, or edtech) is
        the combined use of computer hardware, software, and educational theory and practice to facilitate
        learning.[1][2] When referred to with its abbreviation, "EdTech", it often refers to the industry of
        companies that create educational technology.[3][4][5] In EdTech Inc.: Selling, Automating and
        Globalizing Higher Education in the Digital Age, Tanner Mirrlees and Shahid Alvi (2019) argue "EdTech is
        no exception to industry ownership and market rules" and "define the EdTech industries as all the
        privately owned companies currently involved in the financing, production and distribution of commercial
        hardware, software, cultural goods, services and platforms for the educational market with the goal of
        turning a profit. </p>

      Topcoder community is the primary source of the workforce behind all Topcoder projects. It is open and
      global: anybody, with a few legal restrictions dictated by US laws, and listed in Community Terms, can join
      and compete, without any financial commitment to Topcoder. Also, participation in challenges organized in
      the interests of commercial clients generally requires the community member to sign a non-disclosure
      agreement. Intellectual property for the winning submissions to commercial challenges is passed to the
      client, in exchange for monetary prizes paid to the winners.
      While the majority of community members participate in Topcoder challenges as regular competitors, those who
      become recognized for their performance, and involvement in community life (via communication in Topcoder
      forums, attending Topcoder events, etc.), are offered additional roles in the community, which include:
      copilots (technical coordinators of challenges), problem writers, reviewers, etc Since the end of 2014
      till the end of 2017, a Community Advisory Board (CAB) was selected from active community
